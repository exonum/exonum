//! Utilities allowing to customize proposal creation logic for an Exonum node.
//!
//! To customize block proposals, you should supply a [`ManagePool`] implementation
//! to the [`NodeBuilder`]:
//!
//! ```
//! # use exonum::{keys::Keys, merkledb::TemporaryDB};
//! # use exonum_node::{generate_testnet_config, NodeBuilder, NodeConfig};
//! use exonum_node::pool::{SkipEmptyBlocks, StandardPoolManager};
//!
//! # async fn not_run() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
//! # let (node_config, keys) = generate_testnet_config(1, 2_000).pop().unwrap();
//! let node_config: NodeConfig = // ...
//! #    node_config;
//! let node_keys: Keys = // ...
//! #    keys;
//! let database = TemporaryDB::new();
//! let pool_manager = SkipEmptyBlocks::new(StandardPoolManager::default());
//! let node = NodeBuilder::new(database, node_config, node_keys)
//!     .with_pool_manager(pool_manager)
//!     // specify other node params...
//!     .build();
//! node.run().await?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!

//!
//! # Stability
//!
//! The contents of this module is considered unstable and experimental. It may change in any way
//! between `exonum-node` releases.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! **USING CUSTOM POOL MANAGEMENT LOGIC CAN LEAD TO CONSENSUS HANG-UP AND OTHER ADVERSE EFFECTS.**
//! Consensus safety and liveness properties proven in the [Exonum white paper]
//! **DO NOT HOLD** for arbitrary proposal creation logic.

/// form block proposals. Some use cases for this functionality are as follows:

/// - Whitelist or blacklist public keys authorizing transactions
/// - Whitelist, blacklist, otherwise filter and/or prioritize transactions by the called
///   service + method combination. As an example, this may be used to implement
///   "crypto-economics", in which all transactions need to pay a fee, solve a proof-of-work, etc.
/// - Restrict the number of transactions and their size in a more flexible manner than
///   supported on the consensus level
/// - Skip block creation if certain conditions are met by returning [`ProposeTemplate::Skip`].
///
/// The block proposer is set for each node individually and does not necessarily need to agree
/// among nodes. At the same time, some proposer implementations (such as whitelisting or blacklisting)
/// do not work effectively unless adopted by all validator nodes.
///
/// # Removing Transactions
///
/// The trait implementation can also be used to garbage-collect transactions once a new block
/// or block skip has been accepted by the node. Note that this is the only time when such garbage
/// collection is safe. Indeed, it cannot be safely performed if node has voted for
/// at least one block proposal at the current epoch, since in this case some of removed transactions
/// may belong to this proposal(s). Removing such a transaction from the node pool may result
/// in consensus stalling.
