## [Unreleased]

### Breaking changes

- `exonum::crypto::CryptoHash` trait is introduced, and `StorageValue::hash`
  and `Message::hash` methods are removed. (#442)

  Migration path:

  - For implementations of `StorageValue`, move the `hash` method
    to `CryptoHash` implementation instead.
  - For implementations of `Message` simply remove `hash` method,
    there's a blanket impl of `CryptoHash` for `Message`.
  - Add `use exonum::crypto::CryptoHash` to use the `hash` method.

- The `StorageKey` trait is re-implemented for signed integer types
  (`i8`, `i16`, `i32` and `i64`) to achieve the natural ordering of produced keys.
  (#443)

  This change will break indices using signed integers as keys.
  To emulate the old implementation, you may create a wrapper around a type
  (e.g., `struct QuirkyI32Key(i32)`) and implement `StorageKey` for it using
  big endian encoding. Then, use the wrapper instead of the int type in indices.
  See the unit tests for `StorageKey` for an example.

- `Transaction::execute` method now returns `TransactionResult` that is stored in
  the blockchain and can be accessed through api. The changes made by transactions
  that return `Err` are discarded. To migrate, add `Ok(())` as the last line to
  the `execute` method. More generally, make sure that the method returns `Ok(())`
  on successful execution. (#385)

- Service transactions are now defined through `transactions!` macro that
  automatically assigns transaction IDs based on the declaration order. (#457)

  Migration path:

  - Move all separate transactions declared as `message!` into one
  `transactions!` macro.
  - Remove `ID` constants.
  - Replace `TYPE` constants with a single `SERVICE_ID` constant.

- Several variants were removed from `ApiError` enum. (#474)

  Migration path:

  - Use generic `ApiError::BadRequest` variant or create `IronError` directly.

- `CommandExtension` uses `failure::Error` instead of `Box<std::error::Error>`
  for errors. (#474)

  Migration path:

  - `std::error::Error` can be converted to `failure::Error` via `.into()` method.

- `storage::Error` implements `failure::Fail` instead of `std::error::Error`. (#474)

- `CryptoHash` for `()` now correctly calculates a hash of an empty byte array
  instead of returning `Hash::zero()`. (#483)

- Removed the `'static` bound from the return value of the
  `blockchain::Service::service_name()` method. (#485)

- `StorageKey` trait now requires `ToOwned` implementation. (#392)

### New features

- `StorageKey` and `StorageValue` traits are implemented for `SystemTime`. (#456)

- `StorageValue` and `CryptoHash` traits are implemented for `bool`. (#385)

- `Height` implements `std::str::FromStr`. (#474)

- `v1/transactions` endpoint has been extended with the transaction execution
  status. (#488)

- Key-indexes interface now allows to use borrowed types for the search
  operations. (#392)

### Bug fixes

- `ExonumJsonDeserialize` trait is implemented for `F32` and `F64`. (#461)

## 0.5.1 - 2018-02-01

### Bug fixes

- Fixed logger output (#451)

## 0.5 - 2018-01-30

### Breaking changes

- The order of bytes and bits in the `DBKey` keys of `ProofMapIndex` became
  consistent. (#419)

  The change influences how Merkle Patricia trees are built
  for `ProofMapIndex`: the bits in each byte of a `DBKey` are now enumerated
  from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB),
  compared to MSB-to-LSB ordering used before.
  Note: this change will break old storages using map proofs.

- The `Database` trait is simplified: it is no longer required
  to implement state-sharing `clone` method.
  Instead, the `merge` method now takes a shared reference to `self`. (#422)

- `message!` and `encoding_struct!` no longer require manual `SIZE`
  and offset specification. (#413)

- `from_raw(raw: RawMessage)`  method is moved to the `Message` trait.
  To migrate, add `use exonum::messages::Message`. (#427)

- Changed iterators over `Patch` and `Changes` data into custom types instead
  of standard collection iterators. (#393)

  <!-- spell-checker:disable -->

- Fixed typo in `SparceListIndexKeys` and `SparceListIndexValues`. (#398)

  <!-- spell-checker:enable -->

- Removed default `state_hash` implementation in the `Service` trait. (#399)

- Removed `info` method from the `Transaction`. (#402)

- Replaced config param `timeout_events_capacity` with
  `internal_events_capacity`. (#388)

- The `Transaction` trait now inherits from `ExonumJson`. (#402)

- Renamed `DBKey` to `ProofPath` and moved a part of its functionality
  to the `BitsRange` trait. (#420)

- Added `patch` method to the `Fork` structure. (#393)
- Added a public `healthcheck` endpoint. (#405)
- Added serialization support of floating point types through special wrapper
  (`F32` and `F64`). This feature is hidden behind `float_serialize` gate.
  Note: special values (Infinity and NaN) aren't supported. (#384)

  field in `ConsensusConfig`). (#426)
