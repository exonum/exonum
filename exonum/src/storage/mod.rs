//! A module that provides a high-level interface for working with stored data.
//!
//! # Database
//!
//! A [`Database`] is the underlying type for working with stored data. Internally `Database` is
//! a key-value storage with reading isolation and atomic writing. This is an embedded database,
//! which means that only the Exonum process can access it. You can interact with a `Database` from
//! different threads by cloning its instance.
//!
//! Exonum provides two types of database: [`LevelDB`] and [`MemoryDB`]. However, you can make your
//! own implementations of [`Database`] trait. See its documentation for more.
//!
//! # Snapshot and Fork
//!
//! There is no way to directly interact with data in the database.
//!
//! If you need to read the data, you can create a [`Snapshot`] using method [`snapshot`][1]
//! of the `Database` instance. Snapshots provide a read isolation, so you are guaranteed to work
//! with consistent values even if the data in the database changes between reads. `Snapshot`
//! provides all the necessary methods for reading data from the database, so `&Storage`
//! is used as a storage view for creating read-only [indices] representation.
//!
//! If you need to make any changes to the data, you need to create a [`Fork`] using method
//! [`fork`][2] of the `Database` instance. As well as `Snapshot`, `Fork` provides read isolation
//! and also allows you to create a sequence of changes to the database that are specified
//! as [`Patch`]. Later you can atomically merge a patch into the database using method [`merge`].
//!
//! # `StorageKey` and `StorageValue` traits
//!
//! If you need to use your own data types as keys or values in storage, you need to implement
//! the [`StorageKey`] or [`StorageValue`] traits respectively. These traits are already
//! implemented for most standard types. See their documentation for more.
//!
//! # Indices
//!
//! Indexes are structures that represent high-level data collections that are stored in a database.
//! This concept is similar to tables in relational databases. All indexes are stored in a single
//! key-value table, but internally the keys of each index will be prefixed with the unique index
//! prefixes, so the data of the different indexes do not conflict with each other. The interfaces
//! of the indexes are similar to ordinary collections (like arrays, maps and sets), but their data
//! is located in persistent storage.
//!
//! Merklized indices support the ability to generate the cryptographic proofs about the inclusion
//! of data in them. Having such proof external client may verify locally that received data was
//! really authorized by the validators without having to replicate the entire blockchain contents.
//!
//! Exonum implements the following indices:
//!
//! - [`Entry`] is a specific index that stores only one value. Useful for global values, such as
//! configuration. Similar to combination of [`Box`] and [`Option`] from standard library.
//! - [`ListIndex`] is a list of items stored in sequential order. Similar to [`Vec`] collection
//! from standard library.
//! - [`MapIndex`] is a map of keys and values. Similar to [`BTreeMap`] collection from standard
//! library.
//! - [`ProofListIndex`] is a Merklized version of `ListIndex` which supports the cryptographic
//! proofs of existence and is implemented as a Merkle tree.
//! - [`ProofMapIndex`] is a Merklized version of `MapIndex` which supports the cryptographic
//! proofs of existence and is implemented as a Merkle Patricia tree.
//! - [`KeySetIndex`] and [`ValueSetIndex`] is a set of items, similar to [`BTreeSet`] and
//! [`HashSet`] from standard library.
//!
//! If necessary, it's possible to implement new specific types of indexes. To do this, you need
//! to create a wrapper over [`BaseIndex`] structure. See their documentation for more.
