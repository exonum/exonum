//! Messages used in the Exonum consensus algorithm.
//!
//! Every message, unless stated otherwise, is checked by the same set of rules. The message is
//! ignored if it
//!     * is sent from a lower height than the current one
//!     * contains incorrect validator id
//!     * is signed with incorrect signature
//!
//! Specific nuances are described in each message documentation and typically consist of three
//! parts:
//!     * validation - additional checks before processing
//!     * processing - how message is processed and result of the processing
//!     * generation - in which cases message is generated
