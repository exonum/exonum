//! Messages used in the Exonum consensus algorithm.
//!
//! Every message, unless stated otherwise, is checked by the same set of rules. The message is
//! ignored if it
//!     * is sent from a lower height than the current one
//!     * contains incorrect validator id
//!     * is signed with incorrect signature
//!
//! Specific nuances are described in each message documentation and typically consist of three
//! parts:
//!     * validation - additional checks before processing
//!     * processing - how message is processed and result of the processing
//!     * generation - in which cases message is generated

Connect to a node.

### Validation
The message is ignored if its time is earlier than in the previous `Connect` message received
from the same peer.

### Processing
Connect to the peer.

### Generation
A node sends `Connect` message to all known addresses during initialization. Additionally,
the node responds by its own `Connect` message after receiving `node::Event::Connected`."

Proposal for a new block.

### Validation
The message is ignored if it
    * contains incorrect `prev_hash`

    * contains already committed transactions
    * is already known

### Processing
If the message contains unknown transactions, then `RequestTransactions` is sent in reply.

A node broadcasts `Propose` if it is a leader and is not locked for a different proposal. Also

Pre-vote for a new block.

### Validation
A node panics if it has already sent a different `Prevote` for the same round.

### Processing
Pre-vote is added to the list of known votes for the same proposal.
If `locked_round` number from the message is bigger than in a node state, then a node replies
with `RequestPrevotes`.
If there are unknown transactions in the propose specified by `propose_hash`,
`RequestTransactions` is sent in reply.
Otherwise if all transactions are known and there are +2/3 pre-votes, then a node is locked
to that proposal and `Precommit` is broadcast.

### Generation
A node broadcasts `Prevote` in response to `Propose` when it has received all the transactions."

Pre-commit for a proposal.

A node panics if it  has already sent a different `Precommit` for the same round.

### Processing
Pre-commit is added to the list of known pre-commits.

with `RequestPrevotes`.
