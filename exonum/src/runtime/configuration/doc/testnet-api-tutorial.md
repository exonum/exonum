# Configuration service tutorial

## Running testnet

### Using Docker

<!-- spell-checker:ignore vitvakatu -->

Simply run the following command to configure and launch testnet with 4 nodes:

```bash
docker run -p 8000-8007:8000-8007 vitvakatu/exonum-configuration-example 4
```

Docker will automatically pull image from the repository and run 4 nodes with
public endpoints at `127.0.0.1:8000`, ..., `127.0.0.1:8003` and
private ones at `127.0.0.1:8004`, ..., `127.0.0.1:8007`.

You can also use helper [script](../docker/example-start.sh):

```bash
./docker/example-start.sh <number of nodes>
```

To stop docker container, use `docker stop <container id>` command.

### Manually

#### Build example binary

To build an [example binary](../examples/configuration.rs) of exonum
blockchain with the single configuration service mounted, run:

```bash
cargo install --example configuration
```

`exonum` crate system dependencies and rust toolchain configuration -
[exonum install instructions](https://exonum.com/doc/get-started/install/).

#### Generate testnet directory and config

`4` is a required indexed parameter and stands for the number of nodes in
testnet:

```bash
mkdir -p testnet/configuration_service
cd testnet/configuration_service
configuration generate-testnet --start 5400 4 --output-dir .
cd ..
```

This should create the following config for testnet:

```bash
$ tree configuration_service/
configuration_service/
└── validators
  ├── 0.toml
  ├── 1.toml
  ├── 2.toml
  └── 3.toml
```

#### Run `4` nodes

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

```bash
configuration run --node-config configuration_service/validators/0.toml --db-path configuration_service/db/0 --public-api-address 127.0.0.1:8000 --private-api-address 127.0.0.1:8010
...
configuration run --node-config configuration_service/validators/3.toml --db-path configuration_service/db/3 --public-api-address 127.0.0.1:8003 --private-api-address 127.0.0.1:8013
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

##### Parameters

- `--public-api-address` is for Exonum [public http api endpoints](#public-endpoints)
- `--private-api-address` is for Exonum [private http api endpoints](#private-endpoints)
- `--node-config` path to the node config
- `--db-path` path to the database

## Global variable service http api

All `hash`es, `public-key`s and `signature`s in tables are hexadecimal strings.
`config-body` is a valid json, corresponding to [exonum config] serialization.

### Public endpoints

#### Configurations' structure

This config is called *actual* config.

1. Only single config may be scheduled to become next config at any moment of
   time. This config is called *following* config.

1. For any current config, its *following* config will have `actual_from`
   greater than the `actual_from` of current config.

1. For any current config, its *following* config will have `previous_cfg_hash`
   equal to hash of current config.

1. Any config propose gets scheduled to become the *following* config only if
   it gets **2/3+1** supermajority of votes of `validators` of *actual* config.
   Thus, which entities can determine what the *following* config will be is
   specified in the contents of *actual* config.

### Private endpoints

Posting a new config can be performed by any validator maintainer via private
endpoint.

#### Propose and vote transactions restrictions

- Propose transactions will only get submitted and executed with state change
  if all of the following conditions take place:

    1. new config body constitutes a valid json string and corresponds to
       [StoredConfiguration][exonum config] format.

    1. `previous_cfg_hash` in proposed config body equals to hash of *actual*
       config.

    1. `actual_from` in proposed config body is greater than *current height*.
       *current height* is determined as the height of the last
       committed block + 1. This is important to obtain a sequential view of
       configs commit history. And, more important, the linear view of history
       of votes which conditioned scheduling of a config.

    1. a *following* config isn't  already present.

    1. *actual* config contains the node-sender public key in the `validators`
       field array, as specified in `from` field of the propose transaction.
       The `from` field is determined by the public key of the node which
       `postpropose` endpoint is accessed for signing the transaction on
       maintainer's behalf.

    1. propose of config, which evaluates to the same hash, hasn't already
       been submitted.

- Vote transactions will only get submitted and executed with state change if
  all of the following conditions take place:

    1. the vote transaction references a config propose with known config hash.

    1. a *following* config isn't  already present.

    1. *actual* config contains the node-sender's public key in `validators`
       field, as specified in `from` field of vote transaction. The `from`
       field is determined by public key of node whose `postvote` endpoint is
       accessed for signing the transaction on the maintainer's behalf.

    1. `previous_cfg_hash` in the config propose, which is referenced by
       vote transaction, is equal to hash of *actual* config.

    1. `actual_from` in the config propose, which is referenced by vote
       transaction, is greater than *current height*.

    1. no vote from the same node public key has been submitted previously.
