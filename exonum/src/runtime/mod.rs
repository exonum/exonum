//! Common building blocks for creating runtimes for the Exonum blockchain.
//!
//! Each runtime contains specific services to execute transactions, process events,
//! provide user APIs, etc. A unified dispatcher redirects all the calls
//! and requests to the appropriate runtime environment. Thus, a blockchain interacts with the
//! dispatcher, and not with specific runtime instances.
//!
//! # Artifacts
//!
//! Each runtime has its own [artifacts] registry from which users can create a service.
//! The artifact identifier is required by the runtime to construct service instances.
//! In other words, an artifact identifier is similar to a class name, and a specific
//! service instance - to a class instance. A single artifact may be used to instantiate
//! zero or more services.
//!
//! The format of an artifact ID is uniform across runtimes (it is essentially a string),
//! but the runtime may customize artifact deployment via runtime-specific deployment arguments.
//!
//! # Artifact Lifecycle
//!
//! 1. An artifact is assembled in a way specific to the runtime. For example, the artifact may
//!   be compiled from sources and packaged using an automated build system.
//!
//! 2. The artifact with the service is deployed on the blockchain. The decision to deploy the
//!   artifact and the deployment spec are usually performed by the blockchain administrators.
//!   The corresponding logic is customizable via a [supervisor service](#supervisor-service).
//!   What deployment entails depends on the runtime; e.g., the artifact may be downloaded
//!   by each Exonum node, verified for integrity and then added into the execution environment.
//!
//! 3. For each node, an artifact may be deployed either asynchronously or synchronously /
//!   in a blocking manner. The supervisor usually first commands a node to deploy the artifact
//!   asynchronously via [`Mailbox`] once the decision to start deployment is reached
//!   by the blockchain administrators. Async deployment speed and outcome may differ among nodes.
//!
//! 4. The supervisor translates local deployment outcomes into a consensus-agreed result.
//!   For example, the supervisor may collect confirmations from the validator nodes that have
//!   successfully deployed the artifact, and once all the validator nodes have sent
//!   their confirmations, the artifact is *committed*. Being part of the service logic,
//!   artifact commitment is completely deterministic, agreed via consensus,
//!   and occurs at the same blockchain height for all nodes in the network.
//!
//! 5. Once the artifact is committed, every node in the network is required to have it deployed
//!   in order to continue functioning.
//!   If a node has not deployed the artifact previously, deployment becomes blocking; the node
//!   does not participate in consensus or block processing until the deployment is completed
//!   successfully. If the deployment is unsuccessful, the node stops indefinitely.
//!   Due to deployment confirmation mechanics built into the supervisor, it is reasonable
//!   to assume that a deployment failure at this stage is local to the node and
//!   could be fixed by the node admin.
//!
//! # Service Lifecycle
//!
//! 1. Once the artifact is committed, it is possible to instantiate a corresponding service.
//!   Each instantiation request contains an ID of a previously deployed artifact,
//!   a string instance ID, and instantiation arguments in a binary encoding
//!   (by convention, Protobuf). As with the artifacts, the logic controlling instantiation
//!   is encapsulated in the supervisor service.
//!
//! 2. During instantiation, the service is assigned a numeric ID, which is used to reference
//!   the service in transactions. The runtime can execute initialization logic defined
//!   in the service artifact; e.g., the service may store some initial data in the storage,
//!   check service dependencies, etc. The service (or the enclosing runtime) may signal that
//!   the initialization failed, in which case the service is considered not instantiated.
//!
//! 3. Once the service is instantiated, it can process transactions and interact with the
//!   external users in other ways. Different services instantiated from the same artifact
//!   are independent and have separate blockchain storages. Users can distinguish services
//!   by their IDs; both numeric and string IDs are unique within a blockchain.
//!
//! Warning: state hash of the block is not affected by services, instantiated within it. The
//! only exception is the genesis block where object hashes of builtin services are included
//! to the resulting block state hash. This behavior difference will be unified in next release.
//!
//! [`Dispatcher`] is responsible for persisting artifacts and services across node restarts.
//!
//! # Transaction Lifecycle
//!
//! 1. An Exonum client creates a transaction message which includes [`CallInfo`] information
//!   about the corresponding method to call and serialized method parameters as a payload.
//!   The client then signs the message using the Ed25519 signature system.
//!
//! 2. The client transmits the message to one of the Exonum nodes in the network.
//!
//! 3. The node verifies correctness of the transaction signature and retransmits it to
//!   the other network nodes if it is correct.
//!
//! 4. When the consensus algorithm run by Exonum nodes finds a feasible candidate for the next block
//!   of transactions, transactions in the block are passed to the [`Dispatcher`] for execution.
//!
//! 5. The dispatcher uses a lookup table to find the corresponding [`Runtime`] for the transaction
//!   by the [`instance_id`] recorded in the message. If the corresponding runtime is
//!   found, the dispatcher passes the transaction into this runtime for
//!   immediate [execution].
//!
//! 6. After execution the transaction [execution status] is written into the blockchain.
//!
//! # Supervisor Service
//!
//! A supervisor service is a service that has additional privileges. This service
//! allows to deploy artifacts and instantiate new services after the blockchain is launched
//! and running. Other than that, it looks like an ordinary service.
//! The supervisor should be present during the blockchain start, otherwise no new artifacts / services
//! could ever be added to the blockchain.
//!
//! The supervisor service is distinguished by its numerical ID, which must be set
//! to [`SUPERVISOR_INSTANCE_ID`]. Services may assume that transactions originating from
//! the supervisor service are authorized by the blockchain administrators. This can be used
//! in services: if a certain transaction originates from a service with `SUPERVISOR_INSTANCE_ID`,
//! it is authorized by the administrators.
