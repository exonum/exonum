//! Common building blocks that compose runtimes for the Exonum blockchain.
//!
//! Each runtime contains specific services that execute transactions, process events,
//! provide user APIs, etc. A unified *dispatcher* redirects all the calls
//! and requests to an appropriate runtime environment. Thus, a blockchain interacts with the
//! dispatcher, and not with specific runtime instances.
//!
//! # Artifacts
//!
//! An artifact creates service instances similar to classes in object-oriented programming.
//! Artifacts reflect the assumption that deploying business logic onto the blockchain
//! may take a long time, may fail, end up with differing results on different nodes, etc.
//! Thus, artifacts decouple the complex *deployment* of the business logic from its instantiation
//! (which we assume is simple / non-fallible).
//!
//! Depending on the runtime, an artifact may have an additional specification required
//! for its deployment; e.g., files to be compiled.
//!
//! Each runtime has its own [artifacts] registry. Users can create services from the stored
//! artifacts. An artifact identifier is required by the runtime to construct service instances.
//! In other words, an artifact identifier is similar to a class name, and a specific
//! service instance - to a class instance. A single artifact may be used to instantiate
//! zero or more services.
//!
//! The format of the artifact ID is uniform across runtimes - it is essentially a string.
//! But the runtime may customize artifact deployment via runtime-specific deployment arguments.
//!
//! # Artifact Lifecycle
//!
//! 1. An artifact is assembled in a way specific to the runtime. For example, an artifact may
//!   be compiled from sources and packaged using an automated build system.
//!
//! 2. The artifact with the service is deployed on the blockchain. The decision to deploy the
//!   artifact and the deployment spec are usually performed by the blockchain administrators.
//!   The corresponding logic is customizable via the [supervisor service](#supervisor-service).
//!   What deployment entails depends on the runtime; e.g., the artifact may be downloaded
//!   by each Exonum node, verified for integrity and then added into the execution environment.
//!
//! 3. For each node, an artifact may be deployed either asynchronously or synchronously, that is
//!   in a blocking manner. The supervisor usually first commands a node to deploy the artifact
//!   asynchronously via [`Mailbox`], once the decision to start deployment is reached
//!   by the blockchain administrators. Asynchronous deployment speed and outcome may differ among
//!   nodes.
//!
//! 4. The supervisor translates the local deployment outcomes into a consensus-agreed result.
//!   For example, the supervisor may collect confirmations from the validator nodes that have
//!   successfully deployed the artifact. Once all the validator nodes have sent
//!   their confirmations, the artifact is *committed*. As a part of the service logic,
//!   artifact commitment is completely deterministic, agreed via consensus,
//!   and occurs at the same blockchain height for all nodes in the network.
//!
//! 5. Once the artifact is committed, every node in the network must have it deployed
//!   in order to continue functioning.
//!   If a node has not deployed the artifact previously, deployment becomes blocking. The node
//!   does not participate in consensus or block processing until the deployment is completed
//!   successfully. If the deployment is unsuccessful, the node stops indefinitely.
//!   The deployment confirmation mechanics is built into the supervisor. Thus, it is reasonable
//!   to assume that a deployment failure at this stage is local to the node and
//!   could be fixed by the node admin.
//!
//! 6. If the artifact is not associated with any services, it can be *unloaded*. Unloading
//!   the artifact may free resources associated with it in the corresponding runtime.
//!   Like other lifecycle events, unloading an artifact is controlled by the supervisor service.
//!
//! # Service Lifecycle
//!
//! 1. Once the artifact is committed, it is possible to instantiate the corresponding service.
//!   Each instantiation request contains an ID of the previously deployed artifact,
//!   a string instance ID, and instantiation arguments in a binary encoding
//!   (by convention, Protobuf). As with the artifacts, the logic that controls instantiation
//!   is encapsulated in the supervisor service.
//!
//! 2. During instantiation the service gets a numeric ID, which is used to reference
//!   the service in transactions. The runtime can execute initialization logic defined
//!   in the service artifact; e.g., the service may store some initial data in the storage,
//!   check service dependencies, etc. If the service (or the enclosing runtime) signals that
//!   the initialization failed, the service is considered not instantiated.
//!
//! 3. Once the service is instantiated, it can process transactions and interact with the
//!   external users in other ways. Different services instantiated from the same artifact
//!   are independent and have separate blockchain storages. Users can distinguish services
//!   by their IDs; both numeric and string IDs are unique within a blockchain. (Note that
//!   the transition to the "active" state is not immediate;
//!   see [*Service State Transitions*](#service-state-transitions) section below.)
//!
//! 4. Active service instances can be stopped or frozen by a corresponding request to the dispatcher.
//!
//! The dispatcher is responsible for persisting artifacts and services across node restarts.
//!
//! A **stopped** service no longer participates in business logic, i.e.,
//! it does not process transactions or hooks, and does not interact with the users
//! in any way. Service data becomes unavailable for the other services,
//! but still exists. The service name and identifier remain reserved
//! for the stopped service and can't be used again for adding new services.
//!
//! **Frozen** service state is similar to the stopped one, except the service
//! state can be read both by internal readers (other services) and external ones
//! (HTTP API handlers).
//!
//! ## Service Hooks
//!
//! Each active service is called before any transactions in the block are processed;
//! we call this `before_transactions` hook. The service may modify the blockchain state in this hook.
//! Likewise, each active service is called after all transactions in the block have been processed
//! (we call this `after_transactions` hook). These calls are quite similar to transactions:
//!
//! - Each call is isolated
//! - Service logic may return an error, meaning that all state changes made within the hook
//!   are rolled back
//! - The service may call other services within the hook
//!
//! ## Service State Transitions
//!
//! Transitions between service states (including service creation) occur once the block
//! with the transition is committed; the effect of a transition is not immediate. This means
//! that, for example, an instantiated service cannot process transactions or internal calls
//! in the block with instantiation, but can in the following block. Likewise, the service hooks
//! (`before_transactions` / `after_transactions`) are *not* called in the block with service
//! instantiation.
//!
//! When the service is stopped or frozen, the reverse is true:
//!
//! - The service continues processing transactions until the end of the block containing
//!   the stop command
//! - The service hooks *are* called for the service in this block
//!
//! # Transaction Lifecycle
//!
//! 1. An Exonum client creates a transaction message which includes two parts. The first part is
//!   the [`CallInfo`] - information about a method to call. The second part is the
//!   serialized method parameters as a payload.
//!   The client then signs the message using the Ed25519 signature system.
//!
//! 2. The client transmits the message to one of the Exonum nodes in the network.
//!
//! 3. The node verifies correctness of the transaction signature and retransmits it to
//!   the other network nodes if it is correct.
//!
//! 4. When the consensus algorithm finds a feasible candidate for the next block
//!   of transactions, transactions in this block are passed to the dispatcher for execution.
//!
//! 5. The dispatcher uses a lookup table to find the corresponding [`Runtime`] for each transaction
//!   by the [`instance_id`] recorded in the transaction message. If the corresponding runtime exists,
//!   the dispatcher passes the transaction into this runtime for immediate [execution].
//!
//! 6. After execution the transaction [execution status] is written into the blockchain.
//!
//! # Data Migration Lifecycle
//!
//! Service data can be migrated to a newer version of the service artifact.
//! See [`migrations` module docs] for details.
//!
//! # Supervisor Service
//!
//! A supervisor service is a service that has additional privileges. This service
//! allows deploying artifacts and instantiating new services after the blockchain is launched
//! and running. Moreover the Supervisor service allows update the configuration or stop the
//! active service instances.
//! Other than that, it looks like an ordinary service.
//!
//! To enable adding new artifacts / services to the blockchain after its start, the supervisor
//! must be one of the builtin service instances.
//!
//! The supervisor service is distinguished by its numerical ID, which must be set
//! to [`SUPERVISOR_INSTANCE_ID`]. Services may assume that transactions originating from
//! the supervisor service are authorized by the blockchain administrators. This can be used
//! in services: if a certain transaction originates from a service with `SUPERVISOR_INSTANCE_ID`,
//! it is authorized by the administrators.

    /// The service instance name and method ID are provided in the `call_info` argument and
    /// the interface name is provided as the corresponding field of the `context` argument.
    ///
    /// A blank interface name denotes the "default" interface; it should be supported by all
    /// services. The methods of the default interface are defined by the service artifact
    /// and thus may have different signatures for different services.
    ///
    /// A non-empty interface name denotes an interface defined externally to the service instance.
    /// In this case, the name is a Protobuf flavor of a fully qualified name
    /// (e.g., `exonum.Configure`). And the method signatures can be inferred from the name
    /// using an interface definition.
    ///
    /// **Note**. Support of non-default interfaces is experimental; as such, an IDL for them
    /// is not stabilized yet.
    ///
    /// # Return Value
    ///
    /// - If the service does not implement an interface, returns a `NoSuchInterface` error.
    /// - If the interface does not have a method, returns a `NoSuchMethod` error.
    ///
    /// An error returned from this method will lead to the rollback of all changes
    /// in the fork enclosed in the `context`.
