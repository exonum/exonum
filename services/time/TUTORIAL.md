# Exonum-time tutorial

Exonum-time is a time oracle service for [Exonum blockchain framework](https://exonum.com/).
This service allows to determine time,
import it from the external world to the blockchain
and keep its current value in the blockchain.

## The Problem

Implementing the business logic of practical solutions requires that
one should be able to access the calendar time.
Said time should meet the following criteria:

* **Reliability**. The time value must be tolerant to the malicious behavior
  of validator nodes.

* **Agreement**. The time must be the same on all the nodes to ensure that
  transactions are executed in a deterministic manner. This means that the time
  should be written in the Exonum blockchain storage. Thus, the "current" time
  will be changing similarly on all nodes during execution of transactions,
  including during nodes update.

* **Sufficient accuracy**. The specified time should be fairly accurate.
  In practice, an acceptable deviation is a few seconds (up to a minute).

* **Monotony**. The time value should only increase. A pragmatic requirement,
  which simplifies use of time when implementing the business logic.

Thus, due to the sufficient accuracy requirement the service cannot use median
time-past from Bitcoin. Indeed, the time in Bitcoin headers is updated every 10
or more minutes and can, in principle, differ by hours from the real time.

## Rationale

Two approaches were considered for obtaining reliable time in Exonum:
_integration with consensus_ and _a time oracle service_.

### Integration with Consensus

The validator includes its local time in each _Precommit_ message.
At the next height the leader includes _+2/3 Precommits_ of the previous block
into the _Propose_. The time median of these _Precommits_ is recorded into
the header of the block obtained based on this _Propose_.

#### Advantages of Integration with Consensus

* The time value is indicated directly in the header of each block making it
  more accessible.

* Time is forcibly updated in the course of consensus operation:
  it is impossible to sabotage update of time without stopping consensus.

* Blockchain is not clogged by the time oracle transactions.

#### Disadvantages of Integration with Consensus

* The consensus code becomes more complex. (Time is included into the consensus
  logic while anchoring and configuration are not.)

* Time is updated with each block. In the case of a large delay in
  block acceptance, all the transactions therein will be executed with
  the same time value.

### Time Oracle Service

Each validator at a specific time sends a transaction indicating its local time
(usually immediately after the commit of each block). Exonum storage contains
an index with the most current time indicated separately by each validator.
Said time median is stored in a separate index, considered the actual time
and is updated after each transaction from any of the validators.

#### Advantages of the Time Oracle Service

* The logic for time update is placed in a separate plug-in service
  (modularity).

* In case of a long delay in block acceptance, the time will be updated along
  with the delayed block execution while executing its transactions.
  Said time will be accurate enough with regard to the time of the transaction
  entry into the pool.

#### Disadvantages of the Time Oracle Service

* The time value is indicated as an index in the Exorum storage, hence,
  receipt thereof by the client requires additional cryptographic checks.

* Each Exonum block will contain time oracle transactions
  (usually one for each validator).

**It was decided that the time oracle should be implemented as
a separate service to develop it separately from the core and
not complicate the consensus code.**

## Assumptions

**Both solutions assume that the local time on all validator nodes is reliable.**
If the local time on the validator machine is incorrect,
**such node is considered Byzantine**. Therefore, both solutions require use of
a reliable time source locally on each validator machine. The solutions
considered here provide only an agreed time on the basis of a reliable local
time of the validator nodes, taking into account possible malicious behavior
of up to 1/3 Byzantine nodes.

To obtain local, reliable time external solutions like [tlsdate][],
[roughtime][], gps-clock, etc. can be applied.

## Implementation of the Time Oracle Service

**The data schema** of such a service consists of two indices:

* `time: Entry<SystemTime>` - is the consolidated time we target at.

* `validators_time: ProofMapIndex<PublicKey, SystemTime>` - the last known
  local time of the validator nodes.

The service implements only one transaction consisting of the actual
validator’s time and signed with its key. The logic of such transaction
execution is as follows:

1. It is checked that `PublicKey` belongs to the validator.

2. The time specified in the transaction is greater than said validator’s time
   specified in the storage (transactions potentially can be executed in
   the order reverse to their creation order,
   but the time must change monotonously).

3. The time for this validator is updated in the storage.

4. All values ​​from the `validators_time` index are fetched.

5. All non-validator nodes are filtered off by the public keys
   (since the validators list can change, the index may contain time values
   ​​for non-valid validators).

6. The number of the remaining values must be equal or greater than `2f + 1`
   (where `f = (n - 1) / 3` - the maximum number of Byzantine validators).

7. The resulting list is sorted down from the largest value to the lowest one.

8. `f + 1` time in the resulting list is taken.

9. If the time from `8.` is larger than `time`, the value in the storage
   is replaced with the resulting value.

Thus, the consolidated time can be updated after each transaction with
the actual time from any validator node, taking into account the possibility
of change in the validators list, ensuring monotony of such time flow and
being tolerant to the malicious behavior of the Byzantine nodes.

It is clear that in a system with no more than `f` Byzantine nodes,
any time in the `[f + 1, 2f + 1]` interval is:

* either the time of an honest node

* or the time in the interval between the timestamps of two honest nodes
  (and therefore such a time can be considered reliable)

For practical reasons, we always choose the `f + 1` timestamp,
since this value is reliable and at the same time the most recent one.

Potentially, the validator nodes can generate and send a transaction to update
the time any moment, however, in the current implementation the nodes send
the transaction after commit of each block.

At the time when a new blockchain is launched, the consolidated time is unknown
until the transactions from at least `2f + 1` validator nodes are processed.
Further in the course of blockchain operation this time
will strictly grow monotonously.

## REST API

The service has one endpoint per Public API and Private API:

* [Get current time](#current-time)
* [Get current validators times](#current-validators-times)
* [Get all validators times](#all-validators-times)

All REST endpoints share the same base path, denoted **{base_path}**,
equal to `api/services/exonum_time/v1`.

**Tip.** See [Service][services] for a description of types
of endpoints in the service.
