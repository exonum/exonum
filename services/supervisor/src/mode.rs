//! Module with available running modes for Supervisor.
//!
//! Currently two modes are available:
//! - Simple mode. Within simple mode, the amount of checks performed by the Supervisor
//!   is reduced to the minimum: the only requirement is that every request is sent
//!   by the validator.
//! - Decentralized mode. Within decentralized mode, deploy requests
//!   and config proposals should be approved by at least (2/3+1) validators.
