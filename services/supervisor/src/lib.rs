//! Supervisor is an [Exonum][exonum] service capable of the following activities:
//!
//! - Deploying service artifacts and unloading unused artifacts
//! - Instantiating services
//! - Changing configuration of instantiated services
//! - Changing a state of instantiated services: stopping, freezing, resuming,
//!   and initiating data migrations
//! - Changing consensus configuration
//!
//! More information on the artifact / service lifecycle can be found in the
//! documentation of [service lifecycle][docs:lifecycle] and the [supervisor][docs:supervisor].
//!
//! Supervisor service has two different operating modes: a "simple" mode and a "decentralized" mode.
//! The difference between modes is in the decision making approach:
//!
//! - Within the decentralized mode, to deploy a service or apply a new configuration,
//!   more than 2/3rds of validators should reach a consensus;
//! - Within the simple mode, any decision is executed after a single validator approval.
//!
//! The simple mode can be useful if one network administrator manages all the validator nodes
//! or for testing purposes (e.g., to test service configuration with `TestKit`).
//! For a network with a low node confidence, consider using the decentralized mode.
//!
//! # Interaction
//!
//! The intended way to interact with supervisor is the REST API. To be precise, requests should
//! be sent to the one of the following endpoints: `deploy-artifact`, `propose-config` or
//! `confirm-config`. Once received, supervisor will convert the request into appropriate
//! transaction, sign it with the validator keys and broadcast for the rest of the network.
//!
//! Key point here is that user **should not** send transactions to the supervisor by himself.
//!
//! To deploy an artifact, one (within the "simple" mode) or majority (within the "decentralized" mode)
//! of the nodes should receive a [`DeployRequest`] message through API. You may use the `seed`
//! field of `DeployRequest` to retry the request with the same params. To check the current
//! status of a request, you may use the `deploy-status` endpoint.
//!
//! To request a config change, one node should submit a [`ConfigPropose`] message through API.
//! For the "simple" mode no more actions are required. For the "decentralized" mode the majority of the nodes
//! should also submit [`ConfigVote`] messages with a hash of the proposed configuration.
//! The proposal initiator that receives the original [`ConfigPropose`] message must not vote for the configuration.
//! This node votes for the configuration propose automatically.
//!
//! Starting, resuming or freezing a service, or unloading an artifact
//! are treated similarly to a configuration change and follow the same rules.
//!
//! ## Migrations Management
//!
//! Supervisor service provides a functionality to perform data migrations for services.
//! Request for migration is sent through private REST API and contains the name of instance
//! to migrate, end artifact version to achieve after migration, and deadline height until which
//! migration should be completed. Similar to artifact deployment, you may check the request
//! status via the `migration-status` endpoint.
//!
//! ### Requirements
//!
//! The following requirements should be satisfied in order to start a migration:
//!
//! - Target service instance should exist and be stopped or frozen.
//! - End artifact for a migration should be a superior version of the artifact of target instance.
//! - New (end) version of artifact should be deployed.
//!
//! Violation of any of requirements listed above will result in a request failure without
//! actual start of migration.
//!
//! ## Migration Workflow
//!
//! Migration starts after the block with the request is committed and is performed asynchronously.
//!
//! After the local migration completion, validator nodes report the result of migration, which can
//! be either successful or unsuccessful.
//!
//! If all validators report the successful local migration result, and the resulting state hashes
//! match, migration is committed and flushed in the block, next to block with the last required
//! migration confirmation.
//!
//! In any other case (e.g. migration failure for at least one node, resulting state hash divergence,
//! lack of report at the deadline height), migration is considered failed and rolled back.
//!
//! After fixing the reason for migration failure, the migration attempt can be performed once again.
//! It will require a different deadline height or a different seed, since `MigrationRequest` objects
//! are considered unique and supervisor won't attempt to perform the same `MigrationRequest` again.
//!
//! ### Complex Migrations
//!
//! If migration contains more than one migration script (e.g. if you need to migrate service from
//! version 0.1 to version 0.3, and this will include execution of two migration scripts: 0.1 -> 0.2
//! and 0.2 -> 0.3), supervisor will execute one migration script at the time.
//!
//! After the first migration request to version 0.3, migration will be performed for version 0.2,
//! and you need to create the same migration request with a different deadline height or seed.
//! After the second migration request, the version will be updated to 0.3.
//!
//! To put it simply, you may need to perform the same migration request several times until every
//! step of migration is completed.
//!
//! ### Incomplete Migrations
//!
//! Migrations require only the current and the last version of artifact to be deployed. If you
//! decide to stop migration before reaching the last version (e.g. you requested migration to version
//! 0.3, but decided to go with version 0.2), you will need to deploy the 0.2 artifact
//! in order to resume the migrated service.
//!
//! # HTTP API
//!
//! REST API of the service is documented in the [`api` module](api/index.html).
