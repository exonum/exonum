//! Middleware service providing ways to compose transactions from the simpler building blocks.
//!
//! # Functionality overview
//!
//! ## Transaction batching
//!
//! [Batching] allows to atomically execute several transactions; if an error occurs
//! during execution, changes made by all transactions are rolled back. All transactions
//! in the batch are authorized in the same way as the batch itself.
//!
//! ## Checked call
//!
//! [Checked call] is a way to ensure that the called service corresponds to a specific artifact
//! with an expected version range. Unlike alternatives (e.g., finding out this information via
//! the `services` endpoint of the node HTTP API), using checked calls is most failsafe; by design,
//! it cannot suffer from [TOCTOU] issues. It does impose a certain overhead on the execution, though.
//!
//! [Batching]: trait.MiddlewareInterface.html#tymethod.batch
//! [Checked call]: trait.MiddlewareInterface.html#tymethod.checked_call
//! [TOCTOU]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-check_to_time-of-use
