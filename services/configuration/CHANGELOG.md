The project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Breaking changes

- Most types renamed to avoid stuttering (see [here][stuttering] for
  an explanation of the term) (#496):

  - `ConfigurationService` to `Service`
  - `ConfigurationServiceFactory` to `ServiceFactory`
  - `TxConfigPropose` to `Propose`
  - `TxConfigVote` to `Vote`
  - `ConfigurationSchema` to `Schema`
  - `StorageValueConfigProposeData` to `ProposeData`
  - `CONFIG_SERVICE` constant to `SERVICE_ID`

  Check the crate documentation for more details.

  **Migration path:** Rename imported types from the crate, using aliases
  or qualified names if necessary: `use exonum_configuration::Service as ConfigService`.

- Multiple APIs are no longer public (#496):

  - Message identifiers
  - Mutating methods of the service schema
  - Module implementing HTTP API of the service

  Check the crate documentation for more details.

  **Migration path:** The restrictions are security-based and should not
  influence intended service use.

- `ZEROVOTE` is replaced with the `MaybeVote` type, which is now used
  instead of `Vote` in the schema method signatures. The storage format itself
  is unchanged (#496).
