# Soak Tests for Exonum Nodes

This is an internal crate for subjecting Exonum networks to [soak tests].

## Contents

The crate exposes the following binaries:

- [`toggle`](src/bin/toggle.rs). Tests repeatedly switching a service on and off.
  The service generates transactions in the `after_commit` hook.

- [`send_txs`](src/bin/send_txs.rs). Tests sending transactions to a service
  via `Blockchain::sender()`.

- [`sleepy`](src/bin/sleepy.rs). Tests custom block proposal creation
  (namely, the mode in which nodes do not create blocks unless they have
  uncommitted transactions).

- [`tx_filtering`](src/bin/tx_filtering.rs). Tests custom pool management,
  which includes proposing and retaining in pool only the newest transaction
  (all other transactions are removed from the transaction pool on block commit).

## Usage

Run the selected binary like this:

```sh
cargo run -p exonum-soak-tests --bin $binary
```

Use `--help` option to find out command-line options specific to the binary.

You may want to set up `RUST_LOG` env variable to check events in the nodes
and/or the core library, for example, `RUST_LOG=exonum_node=info,warn`.
