**MerkleDB** is a document-oriented persistent storage
which provides APIs to work with merkelized data structures.
Under the hood, MerkleDB uses RocksDB as a key-value storage.

## Features

- Supports list, map and set collections (aka *indexes*),
  as well as singular elements.
  Further, indexes can be organized into groups, allowing to create
  hierarchies of documents with arbitrary nesting.
- Automated state aggregation of top-level indexes into a single
  *state hash*, which reflects the entire database state.
- Ability to define data layouts in an intuitive, declarative format.
- Basic support of transactions: changes to the storage can be
  aggregated into a fork and then merged to the database atomically.
- Access control leveraging the Rust type system, allowing to precisely
  define access privileges for different actors.
- First-class support of long-running, fault-tolerant data migrations
  running concurrently with other I/O to the storage.
