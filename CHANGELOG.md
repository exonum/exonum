## Unreleased

### Breaking changes

#### exonum

- `before_commit` hook was renamed to the `after_transactions`. (#1577)
- `before_transactions` and `after_transactions` hooks in Rust services
  now return a `Result`. The semantics is the same as for transactions;
  an error or panic in the hook will lead to the rollback of the blockchain
  state. (#1576)
- Errors occurring while executing transactions and `before_transactions` /
  `after_transactions` hooks are now aggregated within each block, rather than
  globally. Errors can be retrieved using `BlockWithTransactions`. (#1576)
- The Rust interface and Protobuf presentation of `ExecutionError` have been reworked.
  Error fields were made private and information about a failing call
  was added. (#1585)
- `ErrorMatch` was introduced to test (e.g., using the testkit) that
  an `ExecutionError` has an expected type, error message and/or location. (#1585)
- `IntoExecutionError` macro was reworked into a separate trait, `ExecutionFail`,
  and a corresponding derive macro. (#1585)

#### exonum-supervisor

- `Supervisor` structure isn't generic anymore. (#1587)

### New features

#### exonum

- `before_transactions` hook for services was introduced. (#1577)

#### exonum-supervisor

- `Supervisor` service now can have initial configuration and implements
  `Configure` interface. (#1587)

## 0.13.0-rc.2 - 2019-12-04

### Breaking changes

#### exonum

- **Most important**: new Dynamic Services feature was introduced. For details see
  the [Dynamic Services](#dynamic-services-feature) section of the changelog.

- Used `rust` version is updated to 1.38.0. (#1481)

- Transaction serialization format was changed to `protobuf`. (#1283)

- `create_checkpoint` method has been implemented for the `RocksDB` struct.
  This method uses
  [RocksDB checkpoints](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Checkpoints)
  functionality under the hood.

- `NotFound` error message for `explorer/v1/block` endpoint now includes
  the actual blockchain height. (#1498)

- `system/v1/rebroadcast` endpoint has been removed. (#1445)

- Added a possibility to specify compression algorithm for the database. (#1447)

- Updated `hex` dependency with changes in the methods signatures of the `ToHex`
  trait. (#1468)

- Validator keys are now derived from single master key. Master key is
  stored in encrypted file. (#1459)

- Command line parameters `--service-key-pass` and `--consensus-key-pass` was
  removed in favor of `--master-key-pass` parameter. For example now you can
  run the node with the command below. (#1459)

    ```bash
    cargo run -- run -d 0/db/ -c 0/node.toml --master-key-pass pass:123
    ```

  - `StoppedTestKit::resume` accepts list of runtimes instead of a list of services.

  - Removed obsolete `TestKit::blockchain_mut` method and `TestKit::blockchain`
  now returns value instead of reference.
  
- Dot symbol is not allowed in service names anymore. (#1558)

- Services can now use `BlockchainData` and `SnapshotExt` types to access data
  from the blockchain in a more structured manner. (#1523)

- `GenesisConfig` is extracted into separate entity. `BlockchainBuilder`, `Node`
 and `Testkit` explicitly accepts it during creation. (#1541)

- Added `DefaultInstance` trait for declaration of builtin services. (#1541)

#### exonum-merkledb

- Nested proofs for `ProofListIndex` are replaced with a flat
  (non-recursive) format. (#1450)

- Differentiated (read-only / read-write) access to the database
  was introduced. (#1523)

- It is now possible to have readonly access to indexes given a `Fork`
  via a `ReadonlyFork` wrapper. Readonly access works like `RefCell::borrow`
  (vs `RefCell::borrow_mut` for `Fork`); it is possible to create an
  unlimited number of indexes with readonly access based on the same fork.
  (#1523)
  
- Service schemas can now use a declarative layout, in which every field
  corresponds to a separate index or a group of indexes. It is possible
  to derive a constructor for such schemas via `FromAccess` derive macro.
  (#1523, #1562)

- New index name restrictions has been added. (#1558)

  - Dot symbol is not allowed anymore in indexes with prefixed access.

  - Index names starting from `__` and not containing a dot `.` are reserved and
    used only for system indexes.

#### exonum-proto

- Introduced a new crate `exonum-proto`. Trait `ProtobufConvert` is moved
  to this crate. (#1496)

#### exonum-protobuf-convert

- Introduced a new crate `exonum-protobuf-convert`. Derive macro
  `ProtobufConvert` is moved to this crate. (#1501)

- Derive macro `ProtobufConvert` now does not derive the `BinaryValue` and
  `ObjectHash` traits. There are separate derive macros for them in
  the `exonum-derive` crate. (#1501)

#### exonum-build

- Method `protobuf_generate` is now private, use `exonum_build::ProtobufGenerator`
  instead (#1496).
  
- Method `ProtobufGenerator::frequently_used` has been removed (#1581).

#### exonum-crypto

- Methods `read_keys_from_file` and `generate_keys` are moved to new `keys`
  module in the `exonum`. (#1459)

- Protobuf serialization for crypto types is now implemented in the `exonum-crypto`
  crate. (#1496)

### Dynamic Services Feature

#### Overview

In `exonum` 0.13, a new service workflow is introduced, named
"Dynamic Services".

Key points of this feature are the following:

- `exonum` now supports different environments of code execution (runtimes).
  Only native `rust` runtime is enabled by default, but support of
  different programming languages can be added quite easily.

  For details see the [`Runtime` trait docs][runtime-trait] and the
  [`sample_runtime` example][sample-runtime].

  [runtime-trait]: https://docs.rs/exonum/0.13.0-rc.2/exonum/runtime/trait.Runtime.html
  [sample-runtime]: https://github.com/exonum/exonum/tree/v0.13.0-rc.2/examples/sample_runtime

- Services are not statically tied to the compiled binary anymore. There is
  support of adding new service types (aka artifacts) dynamically and starting new
  instances of services.

  For details see [`runtime` module docs][runtime-docs].

  [runtime-docs]: https://docs.rs/exonum/0.13.0-rc.2/exonum/runtime/index.html

- Services now can have initialization parameters, provided within service start
  procedure.

- Services now support configuration changes via `Configure` interface.

- `configuration` service was replaced with the `supervisor` service, which is
  capable of not only changing configuration, but of deploying and starting
  services as well. For details see [`supervisor` service][supervisor].

  [supervisor]: https://github.com/exonum/exonum/tree/v0.13.0-rc.2/services/supervisor

#### Migration Guide

There are a lot of backward-incompatible changes introduced within 0.13 release.
So to make the changes apparent, compare the `Cryptocurrency` example service versions
for [0.12.1][crypt-0-12] and [0.13.0][crypt-0-13] releases.

[crypt-0-12]: https://github.com/exonum/exonum/blob/v0.12.1/examples/cryptocurrency/
[crypt-0-13]: https://github.com/exonum/exonum/blob/v0.13.0-rc.2/examples/cryptocurrency/

Key points:

- Merkledb schema is now declarative and can contain indices as fields.

- Access to the database is now isolated for services.
  A service cannot get the write access to another service or the blockchain schema.

- Transactions do not have the `execute` method anymore. Instead, a service defines
  and implements an interface trait which contains all the business logic.

- Services do not launch at the node start by default. For launching a
  service, use an [`exonum-launcher`][launcher] tool.

### New Features

#### exonum

- New config params `http_backend_config.server_restart_max_retries` and
  `http_backend_config.server_restart_retry_timeout` added into `NetworkConfiguration`.
  They are intended to configure restart settings of the HTTP-server (#1536).

- `exonum` now has a `python` library for implementing integration tests. (#1516)

- `BlockchainMut` now has a `check_tx` method used to verify transactions before
  adding them to the transactions pool. Transactions for which `check_tx` fails
  are considered invalid and can't be included to the block. (#1579)

#### exonum-merkledb

- `ProofListIndex` now implements `truncate()` and `pop()` methods, allowing
  to eject elements from the list. (#1455)

- `IndexAccess` trait is implemented for several new types, notably,
  `Rc<dyn Snapshot>`, `Arc<dyn Snapshot>` and `Rc<Fork>`. (#1455)

- `HashTag::hash_list()` was extended to support values of any appropriate type,
  not only `Hash`. (#1455)

- `ProtobufConvert` has been implemented for `MapProof` (#1512) and `ListProof` (#1513).

- New variant of the `ProofMapIndex` have been introduced - `RawProofMapIndex`.
  It is used for keys that maps directly to `ProofPath`, for example `Hash` and
  `PublicKey`. (#1531)

  - By default `ProofMapIndex` is used for keys that implement `ObjectHash`.

  - For `Hash` keys both map variants works the same, because `ObjectHash`
  implementation for `Hash` returns the hash itself.

#### exonum-cli

- Old `fabric` module is replaced with new `exonum-cli` crate. (#1443)

- `exonum-cli` provides a public reexport of `structopt` crate. (#1461)

### Internal Improvements

#### exonum

- `system/v1/shutdown` endpoint has been modified and now accepts empty POST
  requests. (#1526)

- `exonum-protobuf-convert` has been replaced with external `protobuf-convert`
  crate. (#1561)

- `keys` module has been moved into `exonum-keys` crate. (#1497)

#### exonum-merkledb

- `ProofListIndex::extend()` method has been refactored, leading to up to 10x
  performance improvements for large lists. (#1455)

- Proofs building mechanisms have been heavily refactored. (#1460)

#### exonum-testkit

- Configuration change example has been moved to `exonum-supervisor` crate. (#1582)

#### exonum-build

- Now input directory is always added to includes to reduce boilerplate
  code. (#1581)

### Bug Fixes

#### exonum

- Localhost ports 8080/8081 are now allowed in CORS within the `run-dev` mode. (#1415)

#### exonum-merkledb

- `index_metadata` now correctly loads the provided index address name (#1478).

## 0.12.1 - 2019-09-19

### Bug Fixes

#### exonum

- A message length checking has been fixed (#1463)

## 0.12.0 - 2019-08-14

### Breaking changes

#### exonum

- Module `storage` has been replace by `exonum-merkledb` crate. See related section
- Signatures of methods `Service::initialize` and `Service::before_commit` has been
  changed. Now they take immutable reference to `Fork` instead of mutable. (#1293)

- Trait `BinaryForm` has been replaced by `BinaryValue`. (#1298)

  To implement `BinaryValue` for types that implements `Protobuf::Message` use
  `impl_binary_value_for_pb_message` macros.

- Module `storage` has been replaced by `exonum-merkledb` crate. See related section
  in changelog for details. (#1293)

- Bootstrapping workflow has been simplified (#1292)

  `generate-config` subcommand now uses single `OUTPUT_DIR` instead of set of options.
  So to generate node config you should write something like example bellow.

  ```bash
  cargo run --bin exonum-timestamping -- \
    generate-template /tmp/exonum/template.toml --validators-count 4

  cargo run --bin exonum-timestamping -- \
    generate-config /tmp/exonum/template.toml /tmp/exonum/cfg/0 \
      --peer-address 0.0.0.0:8000
  cargo run --bin exonum-timestamping -- \
    generate-config /tmp/exonum/template.toml /tmp/exonum/cfg/1 \
      --peer-address 0.0.0.0:8001
  cargo run --bin exonum-timestamping -- \
    generate-config /tmp/exonum/template.toml /tmp/exonum/cfg/2 \
      --peer-address 0.0.0.0:8002
  cargo run --bin exonum-timestamping -- \
    generate-config /tmp/exonum/template.toml /tmp/exonum/cfg/3 \
      --peer-address 0.0.0.0:8003

  cargo run --bin exonum-timestamping -- \
    finalize /tmp/exonum/nodes/0/sec.toml /tmp/exonum/nodes/0/node.toml \
      --public-configs /tmp/exonum/cfg/{0,1,2,3}/pub.toml

  cargo run --bin exonum-timestamping -- \
    run -d /tmp/exonum/db/0 -c /tmp/exonum/nodes/0/node.toml
  ```

- `explorer/v1/block` endpoint returns a response in a "flat" format. (#1386)

- `explorer/v1/blocks` endpoint with `add_blocks_time` param switched on now returns
  median precommit times in the `time` field within each returned block,
  rather than in a separate array. (#1278)

- `system/v1/mempool` endpoint has been renamed into `system/v1/stats`.
  An additional field in the response of the endpoint was added. The field
  corresponds to the total number of transactions in the blockchain. (#1289)

- `system/v1/mempool` endpoint has been renamed into `system/v1/stats`.
  An additional field in the response of the endpoint was added. The field
  corresponds to the total number of transactions in the blockchain. (#1289)

#### exonum-merkledb

- Added restrictions to index names. Allowable characters in index name: ASCII
  characters, digits, underscores and dashes. (#1388)

- Added `Debug` implementation for `Database`, `Snapshot`, `Iterator` dynamic
  traits (#1363)

- Changed storage layout (#1293)

  - Changed indexes metadata layout in the database.

  - Introduced a generic `IndexState` structure that can be used to store global
    index properties like total number of items.

- Changed `ProofMapIndex` hashing rules for branch nodes and root node.
  Branch nodes is hashing now with 0x04 prefix, root node with 0x03 (#1293).

- Renamed method `merkle_root` of `ProofMapIndex` and `ProofListIndex` to
  `object_hash` (#1293).

- Several mutable indexes now can be create from immutable reference to `Fork` (#1293)

- Relaxed trait bounds for the `ProofMapIndex` keys (#1293)

  Now keys should just implement `BinaryKey` trait instead of the
  `ProofMapKey`, which will be ordered according to their binary
  representation, as in the `MapIndex`.

- Changed `ProofListIndex` hashing rules for leaf nodes and branch nodes according
    to the [certificate transparency](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6962#section-2.1)
    specification. Leaf nodes contain hashes with 0x00 prefix, branch nodes - with
    0x01. (#1293)

- `StorageValue` and `StorageKey` have been renamed to the `BinaryValue`
  and `BinaryKey`. (#1293)

  - Added `to_bytes` method to the `BinaryValue` trait which doesn't consume
    original value instead of the `into_bytes`.
  - `BinaryKey::write` now returns total number of written bytes.
  - `CryptoHash` has been replaced by the `ObjectHash`.

- Changed the hash algorithm of the intermediate nodes in `ProofMapIndex`. (#1293)

  `ProofPath` now uses compact binary representation in the `BranchNode`
  hash calculation.

  Binary representation is `|bits_len|bytes|`, where:

  - **bits_len** - total length of the given `ProofPath` in bits compressed
    by the `leb128` algorithm
  - **bytes** - non-null bytes of the given `ProofPath`, i.e. the first
    `(bits_len + 7) / 8` bytes.

#### exonum-crypto

- Removed deprecated `CryptoHash` trait, use `exonum-merkledb::ObjectHash`
  instead (#1361)

### New features

#### exonum

- New endpoint: `v1/transactions/subscribe`, which subscribe to new transaction events.
  This endpoint accept optional parameters: `service_id` and `message_id`
  (`message_id` as in derive macro `TransactionSet`). (#1335)

- New endpoint: `v1/ws`, which open websocket connection and allow to set multiple
  subscription (for blocks and transaction, filtered by service and transaction id)
  and send transactions (in hex, like in explorer) to blockchain
  (examples can be found in related pull request). (#1335)

### Bug Fixes

#### exonum-testkit

- Fixed `TestKit::add_tx()` method, which previously did not persist
  transactions. (#1278)

### Internal improvements

#### exonum

- `explorer/v1/blocks` endpoint supports `add_precommits` param, which supplies
  each returned block with the `precommits` field. (#1278)

- `explorer/v1/blocks` endpoint allows to specify the lower bound on the returned
  block height with the `earliest` query param. (#1278)

- Added `ProtobufConvert` implementation for byte array with fixed sizes (#1279)

- Added `service_name` getter to the `TransactionContext`. (#1274)

- Allowed to use symbol `-` in index names. (#1277)

- `rocksdb` crate is now used instead of `exonum_rocksdb`. (#1286)

- Added a new endpoint `system/v1/services` for displaying information
  about available services. (#1288)

- Endpoints `explorer/v1/block` and `explorer/v1/transactions` were extended
  with adding additional fields `service_id` and `time`. (#1386)

- Endpoints `explorer/v1/block` and `explorer/v1/transactions` were extended
  with adding additional fields `service_id` and `time`. (#1386)

#### exonum-merkledb

- Updated `ProofMapIndex` data layout. (#1293)

  Path to the root node in merkle patricia tree now has been stored in the index
  state.

- New API for getting and creating indexes. (#1293)

  - Now indexes can be accessed via immutable references from `Snapshot` and
    mutable/immutable references from `Fork`.

  - Introduced method `fork::get_object` to get or create object by address.

  - `get_object_existed` and `get_object_existed_mut` methods of `Fork` and `Snapshot`
    returns optional references to index.
- `rocksdb` crate is now used instead of `exonum_rocksdb`. (#1286)

- Added a new endpoint `system/v1/services` for displaying information
  about available services. (#1288)

- `rocksdb` crate is now used instead of `exonum_rocksdb`. (#1286)

- Added `From<Patch>` trait implementation to `Fork`. (#1403)

#### exonum-testkit

- Implemented "stopping" and "resuming" a `TestKit`, allowing to emulate node
  restarts. (#1278)

## 0.11.0 - 2019-03-15

### Breaking Changes

#### exonum

- Node secret keys are now stored in separate files in a secure way.
  CLI for generating node configs and starting nodes has been extended
  in order to reflect these changes. (#1222, #1096, #1235)

  in `utils` module. (#1222, #1096)

### Internal improvements

- All Exonum crates have been updated to Rust 2018 edition. This means that
  it is required to use Rust 1.31 or newer for compilation. (#1230)

#### exonum

- Added `allow-origin` for `localhost` for public and private api in
  development mode by default. (#1234)

- Added `ProtobufConvert` implementation for `Signature`. (#1241)

- `ctrl+c` handler has been added for correct node stopping. (#1163)

#### exonum-crypto

- `pwbox` dependency has been updated. (#1164)

## 0.10.0 - 2018-12-14

### Breaking Changes

- Changed the message format, which, in turn, has led to changes in
   the byte representation of transactions and precommit messages. (#916)

- `Transaction::execute` now accepts `TransactionContext` as the second
   parameter. `TransactionContext` provides the public key of transaction
   author, ID of current service, and transaction hash. (#943)

- `Transaction::verify` method has been removed. (#1085)

- Every transaction that contains the public key of the author was refactored
   to use the author indicated in `TransactionContext`. (#984 #980 #979 #975 #971)

- `/transactions/` endpoint can now handle transaction messages in hex format.
   Services that used custom endpoints were refactored to
   use `explorer/v1/transactions`. (#943 #984 #980 #979 #975 #971)

- `majority_count` parameter has been moved from `StoredConfiguration`
   to `ConfigurationService` configuration. (#828)

- Removed obsolete `enable_blockchain_explorer` option from `NodeApiConfig`. (#891)

- Consensus messages and inner structs are now serialized with protobuf. (#1028)

- `tx_pool_capacity` parameter has been removed from `MemoryPoolConfig`. (#1036)

- Custom serialization has been removed. (#1088)

#### exonum

- Trait `TransactionSend` was removed.
  `ApiSender` now contains `broadcast_transaction` method. (#943)

- `api::Error::InternalError` now contains `failure::Error` instead of
  `Box<::std::error::Error>`. (#879)

- `TransactionSend::send` now returns `Result<(), failure::Error>`
  instead of `io::Result`. (#879)

- `ApiSender` methods `send_external_message` and `peer_add`
   now returns `Result<(), failure::Error>` instead of `io::Result`. (#879)

- `majority_count` parameter has been added to `generate-template` and
  `generate-testnet` commands. (#828)

- `NodePrivateConfig` fields have been renamed: `listen_addr` to `listen_address`
  and `external_addr` to `external_address`. (#809)

- `NodePublicConfig` `addr` field has been renamed to `address`. (#809)

- Config parameter `external_address` is now a required value. (#826)

- Config parameter `round_timeout` has been renamed to `first_round_timeout`.
  Now timeout for round r is `first_round_timeout + (r-1)*round_timeout_increase`,
  where `round_timeout_increase` is determined as a certain percentage of
  `first_round_timeout`. The value of this percentage is defined in
  `ConsensusConfig::TIMEOUT_LINEAR_INCREASE_PERCENT` constant (10%). (#848)

- `missing_keys`, `entries`, `all_entries` methods of `CheckedMapProof` and
  `MapProof::missing_keys_unchecked` method now return `impl Iterator` instead
  of `Vec`. (#918)

- `Connect` message field `addr` with `SocketAddr` has been removed, `pub_addr`
   with `str` of unresolved external address of the peer is used instead. (#942)

- Endpoint `v1/peers` now returns `ConnectInfo` in incoming connections instead
  of single IP-addresses. (#959)

- `Fork::remove_by_prefix()` method now specifies prefix as `Option<&[u8]>` instead
  of `Option<&Vec<u8>>`. (#1042)

- `TransactionResult` is now serialized using protobuf. Empty description
  of the result is now the equivalent of there being no description
  of the result. (#1075)

- `Service::tx_from_raw` now uses `failure::Error` as an error type. (#1088)

- `transactions!` macro has been removed, `TransactionSet` derive macro
  from `exonum-derive` should be used instead. (#1088)

- `encoding_struct!` macro has been removed, protobuf
  should be used instead. (#1088)

#### exonum-testkit

- Structures in tests and examples are serialized using protobuf now. (#1078)

#### exonum-timestamping

- Structures in tests and examples are serialized using protobuf now. (#1081)

#### exonum-cryptocurrency

- Structures in tests and examples are serialized using protobuf now. (#1081)

#### exonum-configuration

- The `Vote` and `VoteAgainst` now save the transaction hash instead of
  full transaction message. (#984)

- Structures are serialized using protobuf now. (#1086)

#### exonum-time

- Structures are serialized using protobuf now. (#1086)

### New Features

#### exonum-crypto

- Added `utils` module with functions `create_keys_file` for creating
  and `read_keys_from_file` for reading files that contain a
  public key and encrypted secret key. (#1056)

#### exonum

- Added possibility to use domain names instead of IP addresses as a peer's
  addresses. (#826)

- Added `v1/rebroadcast` endpoint that can be used to broadcast all transactions
  from the pool to other nodes. (#859)

- Now each consecutive round is longer than previous by some constant percentage
  of `first_round_timeout`. (#848)

- Added `/v1/blocks/subscribe` endpoint for following block commit events
  through WebSockets (#792).

- Added `MapProof::all_entries_unchecked` method. It is used for more efficient
  calculations in Exonum Java Bindings, but can be used for debug purposes
  as well. (#918)

- Added `listen-address` command line argument to specify different external address
  (`peer-address`) and listen address when generating config files. (#942)

- Peer address is resolved on connect instead of resolving on node startup. (#942)

- Now peers require only one connection to exchange messages between
  them. (#945)

#### exonum-build

- `exonum-build` crate has been added to simplify writing `build.rs` files
  for services that use protobuf code generation. (#1076)

#### exonum-derive

- `exonum-derive` crate has been added with custom derives for `ProtobufConvert`
  and `TransactionSet`. (#1055)

### Bug Fixes

#### exonum

- Bug with pool size overflow has been fixed. (#853)

- Bug in `NoiseWrapper::decrypt_msg` caused by wrong calculation of
  encrypted and decrypted message sizes has been fixed. (#873)

- Transactions (signature) verification benchmark has been fixed. (#673)

- Node no longer panics when transaction pool has a lot of transactions and
  consensus is at round 0. (#673)

- Node now works correctly after consensus re-enable via API. (#902)

- Bug with incorrect EOF handling while decoding network messages has been
  fixed. (#917)

- Bug leading to deletion of excessive data when `clear`ing an index belonging
  to an index family has been fixed. (#1042)

### API Improvements

#### exonum

- `new_in_family` index constructor introduced in #531 now accepts `&str` and `&[u8]`
  as an `index_id` value.

### Internal Improvements

#### exonum

- `NodeHandler::run_handler` now returns `Result<(), failure::Error>`
  instead of `io::Result`. (#879)

- Transactions (signature) verification benchmark has been added. (#808)

- A new function `storage::proof_list_index::root_hash()` has been added
  to efficiently compute Merkle root hash from a list of hashes without
  an intermediate `ProofListIndex`. Verification of block root hashes
  has been optimized as well. (#802)

- `NoiseHandshake::finalize` now returns error if remote peer's public key is not
  in `ConnectList`. (#811)

- Now nodes will switch to `min_propose_timeout` for block proposal timeout
  faster if they receive more than `propose_timeout_threshold` transactions
  during `max_propose_timeout`. (#844)

- Custom log formatting (along with `colored` and `term` dependencies) has been
  removed in favor of `env_logger`. (#857).

- Several dependencies have been updated. (#861, #865, #871)

- Transactions are now verified in a thread pool. Thread pool size is set to
  optimal value by default (CPU count) or can be configured manually. (#673)

- The `finalize` command now does not include the node itself as its own
  trusted peer in the generated configuration. (#892)

- Added a possibility to create `ServiceApiBuilder` with blockchain. (#929)

- `ConnectInfo` and `ConnectList` now stores unresolved addresses as strings. (#942)

- Now `network` module uses `PublicKeys` to identify peers. (#942)

- `system/v1/peers` endpoint now properly returns
  incoming and outgoing connections of the node. (#942)

## 0.9.5 - 2018-12-18

### Internal Improvements

#### exonum

- A version of `snow` dependency has been updated.

## 0.9.4 - 2018-10-24

### New Features

#### exonum

- SegmentField implementation for Option has been added, allowing to
  store optional values inside of transactions. (#1004)

## 0.9.3 - 2018-10-04

### Breaking Changes

#### exonum

- Config parameter `external_address` is now a required value. (#826)

### New Features

#### exonum

- Added possibility to use domain names instead of IP addresses as a peer's
  addresses. In config file domain names can be used in `ConnectList`
  configuration and addresses will be resolved once on startup. (#826)

## 0.9.2 - 2018-09-11

### Internal Improvements

#### exonum

- Added a possibility to create `ServiceApiBuilder` with blockchain. (#929)

## 0.9.1 - 2018-08-02

### Bug Fixes

#### exonum

- `failure` version has been updated to `0.1.2` in order to fix the build issue
  with `failure_derive`. (#845)

- Bug with "unknown propose" execution has been fixed. (#841)

## 0.9.0 - 2018-07-19

### Breaking Changes

#### exonum

- `Command` trait in `helpers::fabric` module became public. (#778)

  Migration path:

  If you override `ServiceFactory::command` method and do a match by a command
  name, just add `use helpers::fabric::Command` import.

- `schema_version` field in `Block` has been removed. (#774)

- Storage in exonum is now versioned. Old databases will not work with this
  update. (#707)

- `Iron`-based web API has been replaced by the new implementation based on
  `actix-web`. (#727)

  Migration path:

  For backend:
  - Remove old dependencies on `iron` and its companions `bodyparser`, `router`
    and others.
  - Simplify the API handlers as follows:

    ```rust
    fn my_handler(state: &ServiceApiState, query: MyQueryType)
    -> Result<MyResponse, ApiError>
    {
      // ...
    }
    ```

    where `MyQueryType` type implements `Deserialize` trait and `MyResponse`
    implements `Serialize` trait.
  - Replace old methods `public_api_handler` and `private_api_handler` of
    `Service` trait by a single `wire_api` method which takes
    `ServiceApiBuilder`. You can use this builder as a factory for your service
    API.
  - `get`, `get_err` and `post` methods in `TestKitApi` have been replaced
    by the more convenient `RequestBuilder`.
    Don't forget to update your testkit-based API tests.

  For frontend:
  - New API implementation supports only query parameters in `GET` requests.
    In this way requests like `GET api/my_method/:first/:second`
    should be replaced by the `GET api/my_method?first=value1&second=value2`.
  - JSON parser for `POST` requests is now more strict.
    In this way you should send `null` in request body even for handlers
    without query parameters.

  See our [examples](examples) for more details.

- `storage::base_index` module has become private along with `BaseIndex` and
  `BaseIndexIter` types. (#723)

- `ServiceFactory` trait has been extended with `service_name` function.(#730)

- Method `name` has been removed from `Run`, `GenerateCommonConfig`,
  `GenerateNodeConfig`, `Finalize`, `GenerateTestnet` and `Maintenance`
  structures (`helpers/fabric` module). (#731)

- `Whitelist` has been replaced by `ConnectList`. Now connection between
  nodes can only be established if nodes exist in each other's connect lists.
  (#739)

  Migration path:

  - Replace `[whitelist]` section in config with `[connect_list.peers]` section
  and specify here all validators' consensus public keys with corresponding
  ip-addresses.
  For example `16ef83ca...da72 = "127.0.0.1:6333"`.

- Healthcheck and consensus endpoints (`v1/healthcheck` and
  `v1/consensus_status`) have been merged to `v1/healthcheck`. (#736, #766)

- Node configuration file is now updated at `ConnectList` update. This is
  achieved via new `ConfigManager` entity. (#777)

  Migration path (required only if you create `Node` manually):

  If you need to update `ConnectList` on file system, pass
  `Some(path_to_node_config)` as the last argument of the `Node::new` method.
  Otherwise, pass `None`.

- `exonum::crypto` types now have truncated `Display`/`Debug` representations. (#797)

  Migration path:

  Use `encoding::serialize::ToHex` instead of `Display` to produce full hexadecimal
  representation. You have to manually check if you need to switch or can keep using
  the truncated representation.

  Use `encoding::serialize::FromHex` instead of `FromStr` for reverse conversion.
  `FromStr` implementation has been removed from crypto types to avoid errors.

### New Features

#### exonum

- Existing sodiumoxide-based cryptographic backend behind opt-out
  sodiumoxide-crypto feature. It also allows to use your own cryptographic
  library with exonum. (#756)

- New kind of CLI commands has been added: `info` command that can be used for
  getting various information from a node that has not been started yet. (#731)
  Currently supported sub-commands:
  - `core-version` - prints Exonum version as a plain string.
  - `list-services` - prints the list of the services the node is built with in
    the JSON format.

- `exonum::crypto::x25519` module to convert keys from Ed25519 to X25519 format
  has been introduced. (#722)

- `storage::Entry` has been extended with `take` and `swap` methods. (#781)

- Added remote public key validation when handling incoming `Connect` message. (#786)

### Bug Fixes

#### exonum

- Fixed bug with incorrect peer status for a turned-off node. (#730)

- `handle_consensus` does not write warning for message from previous
  height any more. (#729)

- `new_in_family` constructor has been added to the `Entry` index. (#790)

- Added missing `external_address` field to the auditor final configuration. (#805)

### Internal Improvements

- `BlockResponse` sends transactions by `Hash` instead of `RawMessage`.
  If the node does not have some transactions, requests are created
  for the corresponding transactions. Due to these changes,
  the block size became significantly smaller. (#664)

## 0.8.1 - 2018-06-15

### New Features

#### exonum

- `RunDev` structure has been made public, so it can be extended now.

- `RunDev` command now generates default values for api addresses in the config.

### Internal Improvements

#### exonum

- Dependencies versions have been updated:
  - `exonum_sodiumoxide` to `0.0.19`.
  - `exonum_rocksdb` to `0.7.4`.

## 0.8 - 2018-05-31

### Breaking Changes

#### exonum

- `handle_commit` method in `Service` trait  has been renamed to
  `after_commit`. (#715)

- `TimeoutAdjusterConfig` has been removed along with different timeout
  adjusters. Current behavior is similar to the `Dynamic` timeout adjuster and
  can be modified through `min_propose_timeout`, `max_propose_timeout` and
  `propose_timeout_threshold` fields in the `ConsensusConfig`. (#643)

  Migration path:

  - `Constant` timeout adjuster can be emulated by setting equal
  `min_propose_timeout` and `max_propose_timeout` values.
  - For `Dynamic` timeout adjuster simply move `min`, `max` and `threshold`
    values into `min_propose_timeout`, `max_propose_timeout` and
    `propose_timeout_threshold` correspondingly.
  - There is no possibility to emulate `MovingAverage` now, so `Dynamic` should
    be used as the closest alternative.

- Network connections are now encrypted using
  [Noise Protocol](https://noiseprotocol.org/). Nodes compiled with old
  version will not connect to the new ones. Therefore you need to
  update all node instances for the network to work. (#678)

- `storage::Error` constructor has been made private. (#689)

- `ConsensusConfig::validate_configuration` method has been renamed to the
  `warn_if_nonoptimal`. (#690)

#### exonum-time

- The service has been refactored and the following public structs has been
  moved to separate modules: `TimeSchema` to `exonum_time::schema`,
  `TimeProvider` and `MockTimeProvider` to `exonum_time::time_provider`,
  `ValidatorTime` to `exonum_time::api`. (#604)

### New Features

#### exonum

- Private API now support CORS. (#675)

- The `--public-allow-origin` and `--private-allow-origin` parameters have been
  added to the `finalize` command. (#675)

- IPv6 addressing is now supported. (#615)

- `Field`, `CryptoHash`, `StorageValue` and `ExonumJson` traits have been
  implemented for `chrono::Duration` structure. (#653)

- `before_commit` method has been added in `Service` trait. (#667) (#715)

- `Field`, `CryptoHash`, `StorageKey`, `StorageValue` and `ExonumJson` traits
  have been implemented for `rust_decimal::Decimal`. (#671)

- Maintenance CLI command for node management has been added. Currently the only
  supported command is `clear-cache` which clears node message cache. (#676)

- `StoredConfiguration` validation has been extended with `txs_block_limit`
  parameter check. (#690)

- A warning for non-optimal `StoredConfiguration::txs_block_limit` value has been
  added. (#690)

- Private api `/v1/network/` endpoint now returns core version in addition to
  service info. (#701)

#### exonum-timestamping

- Additional service example has been added along with frontend. (#646)

#### exonum-cryptocurrency-advanced

- Advanced cryptocurrency example becomes a public library (is published on
  crates.io). (#709)

### Bug Fixes

#### exonum

- Already processed transactions are rejected now in
  `NodeHandler::handle_incoming_tx` method. (#642)

- Fixed bug with shutdown requests handling. (#666)

- Fixed deserialization of the `MapProof` data structure. (#674)

- Fixed a bug which prevented the node from reaching the actual round. (#680 #681)

#### exonum-configuration

- Error description has been added to the return value of the transactions. (#695)

#### exonum-time

- Error description has been added to the return value of the transactions. (#695)

#### exonum-cryptocurrency-advanced

- Frontend has been updated to reflect latest backend changes. (#602 #611)

### Internal Improvements

#### exonum

- Default implementation of `check` method was added to `Field` trait to
  reduce boilerplate. (#639)

- Metrics are now using `chrono::DateTime<Utc>` instead of `SystemTime`. (#620)

#### exonum-configuration

- Method `ProposeData::set_history_hash` has been removed. (#604)

## 0.7 - 2018-04-11

### Breaking Changes

#### exonum

- POST-requests are now handled with `bodyparser` crate, so all the parameters
  must be passed in the body. (#529)

- `ProofListIndex` and `ProofMapIndex` `root_hash` method has been renamed to
  `merkle_root`. (#547)

- Proofs of existence / absence for `ProofMapIndex`s have been reworked. They
  now have a linear structure with two components: key-value pairs, and
  additional *proof* information allowing to restore the Merkle root of the
  entire index. `MapProof` interface has been reworked correspondingly. (#380)

  Migration path:

  - Consult documents for the updated workflow for creation and verification
    of `MapProof`s.
  - See the README in the `storage::proof_map_index` module for theoretical
    details about the new proof structure.

- `with_prefix` constructor of all index types has been renamed to
  `new_in_family`. Now it uses `index_id` instead of prefixes. Moreover,
  `blockchain::gen_prefix` method has been removed. Instead, any type that
  implements `StorageKey` trait, can serve as an `index_id`. (#531)

- Several `Schema`'s methods have been renamed (#565):
  - `tx_location_by_tx_hash` to `transactions_locations`.
  - `block_txs` to `block_transactions`.

- `SystemTime` previously used as storage key or value turned out to show
  different behavior on different platforms and, hence, has been replaced with
  `chrono::DateTime<Utc>` that behaves the same in any environment. (#557)

  Migration path:

  - Replace all `SystemTime` fields with `chrono::DateTime<Utc>` ones.
  - Use `DateTime::from` and `into()` methods to convert your existing
  `SystemTime` instances into suitable type when constructing transactions or
  working with database.

- `Blockchain` method `tx_from_raw()` now returns
  `Result<Box<Transaction>, MessageError>` instead of `Option<Box<Transaction>>`.
  (#567)

- `events` module becomes private. (#568)

- `CryptoHash` trait is no longer implemented for `Hash`. (#578)

- `network_id` attribute has been removed from `NodeInfo` and `RawMessage`.
  `HEADER_LENGTH` remains the same, first byte of `RawMessage` is now reserved and
  always set to `0`. (#579)

- `exonum::explorer` module has been reworked to add new functionality.
  (#535, #600) In particular:

  - The explorer now allows to iterate over blocks in the blockchain in the
    given height range, replacing old `blocks_range` method.
  - `block_info` and `tx_info` methods of the explorer are renamed to `block`
    and `transaction` respectively.
  - `TransactionInfo` moved from the `api::public` module to the `explorer` module.
  - `BlocksRange` moved from the `explorer` module to the `api::public` module.
  - `TxInfo` is renamed to `CommittedTransaction`.
  - `BlockInfo` fields are private now, yet accessible with getter methods.

  Migration path:

  - Rename imported types and methods as specified above
  - Use explicit type parameter in `TransactionInfo` and `CommittedTransaction`
    (e.g., `TransactionInfo<serde_json::Value>` or `TransactionInfo<MyTransaction>`)
    if you need to deserialize transaction-related data returned from
    the explorer HTTP API.
  - Consult `explorer` module docs for further possible changes in API.

- `validators-count` command-line parameter has been added. Now, when generating
  config template using `generate-template` command, you must specify the number
  of validators. (#586)

- `majority_count` parameter has been added to the `StoredConfiguration`. See
  `exonum-configuration` changes for more details. (#546)

#### exonum-testkit

- Rollback mechanism in `Testkit` is reworked to work with checkpoints (#582):
  - old `rollback` by blocks in `Testkit` was removed;
  - `checkpoint` method was introduced to set checkpoints;
  - new `rollback` rolls back to the last set checkpoint.

  Migration path:
  - Replace every old `rollback(blocks)` by a pair of `checkpoint()` and `rollback()`.

- Testkit api now contains two methods to work with the transaction pool (#549):
  - `is_tx_in_pool` - for checking transaction existence in the pool;
  - `add_tx` - for adding a new transaction into the pool.

  Migration path:

  - Instead of calling `mempool()`, one should use `is_tx_in_pool`
  or `add_tx` methods.

- `TestKitApi::get_err` method now returns `ApiError`, rather than a deserialized
  object, as it is for `get`. For checking such results
  in tests you may want to use `assert_matches`.

#### exonum-configuration

- `majority_count: Option<u16>` configuration parameter is introduced. Allows to
  increase the threshold amount of votes required to commit a new configuration
  proposal. By default the number of votes is calculated as 2/3 + 1 of total
  validators count. (#546)

#### exonum-time

- `SystemTime` has been replaced with `chrono::DateTime<Utc>`, as it provides
  more predictable behavior on all systems. (#557)

### New Features

#### exonum

- `ExecutionError::with_description` method now takes `Into<String>` instead of
  `String` which allows to pass `&str` directly. (#592)

- New `database` field added to the `NodeConfig`. This optional setting adjusts
  database-specific settings, like number of simultaneously opened files. (#538)

- `ExecutionError::with_description` method now takes `Into<String>` instead of
  `String` which allows to pass `&str` directly. (#592)

- New `database` field added to the `NodeConfig`. This optional setting adjusts
  database-specific settings, like number of simultaneously opened files. (#538)

- Added `v1/user_agent` endpoint with information about Exonum, Rust and OS
  versions. (#548)

- `ProofMapIndex` now allows to retrieve a proof of presence / absence for an
  arbitrary number of elements at one time with the help of `get_multiproof`
  method. Correspondingly, `MapProof` allows to verify proofs for an arbitrary
  number of elements. (#380)

- `storage::UniqueHash` trait that represents a unique, but not necessary
  cryptographic hash function, is introduced. (#579)

- Added the opportunity to parse configuration files with missing empty structures.
  Fields of such structures are equal to the default values. (#576)

- `CryptoHash`, `Field`, `StorageKey` and `StorageValue` traits are implemented for
  the `uuid::Uuid`. (#588)

- `Display` trait is implemented for types from the `crypto` module. (#590)

- `transactions!` macro now allows empty body. (#593)

#### exonum-testkit

- `create_block*` methods of the `TestKit` now return the information about
  the created block. (#535)

- `TestKit::explorer()` method allows to access the blockchain explorer. (#535)

#### exonum-cryptocurrency-advanced

- A more complex example has been added featuring best practices for service
  writing. (#595)

### Internal Improvements

#### exonum

- `RawTransaction` now has its own implementation of `fmt::Debug` trait instead
  of `#[derive(Debug)]`. The template of `RawTransaction`’s debug message is
  `Transaction { version: #, service_id: #, message_type: #, length: #,
  hash: Hash(###) }`. (#603)

- Non-committed transactions are now stored persistently in the storage instead
  of memory pool. (#549)

- Sandbox tests have been moved inside of the exonum core. (#568)

- The requested transactions in the `TransactionsRequest` are now sent by batches,
  rather than one by one. The number of batches depends on the size limits
  of the message. (#583)

#### exonum-testkit

- Request logging for `TestKitApi` now encompasses all requests. The log format
  is slightly changed to allow for the generic request / response form. (#601)

## 0.6 - 2018-03-06

### Breaking Changes

#### exonum

- `exonum::crypto::CryptoHash` trait is introduced, and `StorageValue::hash`
  and `Message::hash` methods are removed. (#442)

  Migration path:

  - For implementations of `StorageValue`, move the `hash` method
    to `CryptoHash` implementation instead.
  - For implementations of `Message` simply remove `hash` method,
    there's a blanket impl of `CryptoHash` for `Message`.
  - Add `use exonum::crypto::CryptoHash` to use the `hash` method.

- The `StorageKey` trait is re-implemented for signed integer types
  (`i8`, `i16`, `i32` and `i64`) to achieve the natural ordering of produced keys.
  (#443)

  This change will break indices using signed integers as keys.
  To emulate the old implementation, you may create a wrapper around a type
  (e.g., `struct QuirkyI32Key(i32)`) and implement `StorageKey` for it using
  big endian encoding. Then, use the wrapper instead of the int type in indices.
  See the unit tests for `StorageKey` for an example.

- `Transaction::execute` method now returns `TransactionResult` that is stored in
  the blockchain and can be accessed through api. The changes made by transactions
  that return `Err` are discarded. To migrate, add `Ok(())` as the last line to
  the `execute` method. More generally, make sure that the method returns `Ok(())`
  on successful execution. (#385)

- Service transactions are now defined through `transactions!` macro that
  automatically assigns transaction IDs based on the declaration order. (#457)

  Migration path:

  - Move all separate transactions declared as `message!` into one
  `transactions!` macro.
  - Remove `ID` constants.
  - Replace `TYPE` constants with a single `SERVICE_ID` constant.

- Several variants were removed from `ApiError` enum. (#474)

  Migration path:

  - Use generic `ApiError::BadRequest` variant or create `IronError` directly.

- `CommandExtension` uses `failure::Error` instead of `Box<std::error::Error>`
  for errors. (#474)

  Migration path:

  - `std::error::Error` can be converted to `failure::Error` via `.into()` method.

- `storage::Error` implements `failure::Fail` instead of `std::error::Error`. (#474)

- `CryptoHash` for `()` now correctly calculates a hash of an empty byte array
  instead of returning `Hash::zero()`. (#483)

- Removed the `'static` bound from the return value of the
  `blockchain::Service::service_name()` method. (#485)

- `StorageKey` trait now requires `ToOwned` implementation. (#392)

- `Connect` message has been extended with a user agent string, which breaks
  binary compatibility with previous versions. (#362)

- Log output become more human-readable. Now it uses `rfc2822` for time formatting.
  This change can break scripts that analyze the log output. (#514)

- `output_dir` argument of the `generate-testnet` command has been renamed to
  `output-dir`. (#528)

- `peer_addr` argument of the `generate-config` command has been renamed to
  `peer-address`. (#528)

- `Blockchain::new` and `Node::new` now accept `Into<Arc<Database>>` instead
  of `Box<Database>`. (#530)

  Migration path:

  - Just pass database argument as is, for example instead of
    `Box::new(MemoryDb::new())` use `MemoryDb::new()`.

#### exonum-configuration

- Most types renamed to avoid stuttering (see [here][stuttering] for
  an explanation of the term) (#496):

  - `ConfigurationService` to `Service`
  - `ConfigurationServiceFactory` to `ServiceFactory`
  - `TxConfigPropose` to `Propose`
  - `TxConfigVote` to `Vote`
  - `ConfigurationSchema` to `Schema`
  - `StorageValueConfigProposeData` to `ProposeData`
  - `CONFIG_SERVICE` constant to `SERVICE_ID`

  Check the crate documentation for more details.

  **Migration path:** Rename imported types from the crate, using aliases
  or qualified names if necessary: `use exonum_configuration::Service as ConfigService`.

[stuttering]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/style/naming/README.html#avoid-redundant-prefixes-[rfc-356]

- Multiple APIs are no longer public (#496):

  - Message identifiers
  - Mutating methods of the service schema
  - Module implementing HTTP API of the service

  Check the crate documentation for more details.

  **Migration path:** The restrictions are security-based and should not
  influence intended service use.

<!-- cspell:disable -->

- `ZEROVOTE` is replaced with the `MaybeVote` type, which is now used
  instead of `Vote` in the schema method signatures. The storage format itself
  is unchanged (#496).

<!-- cspell:enable -->

#### exonum-time

- The structure `Time` is removed, use `SystemTime`
  for saving validators time in `ProofMapIndex` instead. (#20)

- Renamed methods `validators_time`/`validators_time_mut` to
  `validators_times`/`validators_times_mut` in `Schema`. (#20)

### New Features

#### exonum

- `StorageKey` and `StorageValue` traits are implemented for `SystemTime`. (#456)

- `StorageValue` and `CryptoHash` traits are implemented for `bool`. (#385)

- `Height` implements `std::str::FromStr`. (#474)

- `v1/transactions` endpoint has been extended with the transaction execution
  status. (#488)

- Key-indexes interface now allows to use borrowed types for the search
  operations. (#392)

- `TransactionInfo` from the public api module became public. (#537)

#### exonum-testkit

- Modified signature of the `TestKitApi::send` method, which previously did not
  accept `Box<Transaction>`. (#505)

- Added possibility to init a logger in `TestKitBuilder`. (#524)

#### exonum-configuration

  and `/v1/configs/committed` endpoints is extended with the hash of the corresponding
  proposal and votes for the proposal (#481).

- Implemented error handling based on error codes (#496).

### Bug Fixes

#### exonum

- `ExonumJsonDeserialize` trait is implemented for `F32` and `F64`. (#461)

- Added round and propose timeouts validation. (#523)

- Fixed bug with the extra creation of the genesis configuration. (#527)

- Fixed panic "can't cancel routine" during node shutdown. (#530)

### Internal Improvements

#### exonum

- Consensus messages are stored persistently (in the database), so restart will
  not affect the node's behavior. (#322)

- Runtime index type checks have been implemented for every index. (#525)

## 0.5.1 - 2018-02-01

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed logger output. (#451)

## 0.5 - 2018-01-30

### Breaking Changes

- The order of bytes and bits in the `DBKey` keys of `ProofMapIndex` became
  consistent. (#419)

  The change influences how Merkle Patricia trees are built
  for `ProofMapIndex`: the bits in each byte of a `DBKey` are now enumerated
  from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB),
  compared to MSB-to-LSB ordering used before.
  Note: this change will break old storages using map proofs.

- The `Database` trait is simplified: it is no longer required
  to implement state-sharing `clone` method.
  Instead, the `merge` method now takes a shared reference to `self`. (#422)

- `message!` and `encoding_struct!` no longer require manual `SIZE`
  and offset specification. (#413)

- `from_raw(raw: RawMessage)`  method is moved to the `Message` trait.
  To migrate, add `use exonum::messages::Message`. (#427)

- Changed iterators over `Patch` and `Changes` data into custom types instead
  of standard collection iterators. (#393)

  <!-- spell-checker:disable -->

- Fixed typo in `SparceListIndexKeys` and `SparceListIndexValues`. (#398)

  <!-- spell-checker:enable -->

- Removed default `state_hash` implementation in the `Service` trait. (#399)

- The `Transaction` trait now inherits from `ExonumJson`. (#402)

- Renamed `DBKey` to `ProofPath` and moved a part of its functionality
  to the `BitsRange` trait. (#420)

### New Features

- Added `patch` method to the `Fork` structure. (#393)
- Added a public `healthcheck` endpoint. (#405)
- Added serialization support of floating point types through special wrapper
  (`F32` and `F64`). This feature is hidden behind `float_serialize` gate.
  Note: special values (Infinity and NaN) aren't supported. (#384)
- Added a possibility to set maximum message size (`pub max_message_len`
  field in `ConsensusConfig`). (#426)
- Added support for CORS. (#406)
- Added `run-dev` command that performs a simplified node launch
  for testing purposes. (#423)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed consensus on the threshold of 1/3 sleeping validators. (#388)
- Fixed a bunch of inconsistencies and mistakes in the docs. (#439)
- Fixed a bug with message header validation. (#430)

### Internal Improvements

- The list of peer connections is now restored to the latest state
  after the process is restarted. (#378)
- Log dependency was updated to 0.4, which can cause issues
  with the previous versions. (#433)
- Better error reporting for configs in the `.toml` format. (#429)

## 0.4 - 2017-12-08

  or `Transaction` traits. (#366)
- Added constructor for the `ServiceContext` which can be useful
  for the alternative node implementations. (#366)

- `add_transaction` in the `ServiceContext` replaced by the `transaction_sender`
  which implements the `TransactionSend` trait. (#366)
- The `Node` constructor now requires `db` and `services` variables
  instead of `blockchain` instance. (#366)
- The `Blockchain` constructor now requires services keypair
  and an `ApiSender` instance. (#366)
