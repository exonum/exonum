## 0.4 - 2017-12-08

### Added
- Allow creating auditor node from command line. (#364)
- Added a new function `merge_sync`. In this function a write will be flushed from the operating system buffer cache before the write is considered complete. (#368)
- Added conversion into boxed values for values which implement `Service` or `Transaction` traits. (#366)
- Added constructor for the `ServiceContext` which can be useful for the alternative node implementations. (#366)
- Implemented `AsRef<RawMessage>` for any Exonum messages that were created using the `message!` macro. (#372)
- Implemented additional checks for conversion from raw message. (#372)

### Changed
- Changed a signature of `open` function in a `rocksdb` module. `RocksDBOptions` should pass by the reference. (#369)
- `ValidatorState` in the `ServiceContext` replaced by the `ValidatorId`. (#366)
- `add_transaction` in the `ServiceContext` replaced by the `transaction_sender` which implements the `TransactionSend` trait. (#366)
- The `Node` constructor now requires `db` and `services` variables instead of `blockchain` instance. (#366)
- The `Blockchain` constructor now requires services keypair and an `ApiSender` instance. (#366)
- `mount_*_api` methods in `Blockchain` instance now do not require `ApiContext`. (#366)
- Rename method `last_height` to `height` in `Schema`. (#379)
- `last_block` now returns `Block` instead of `Option<Block>`. (#379)
- Replaced `rocksdb` commandline parameter to more generic `db-path`. (#376)
- Obsolete trait `HexValue` replaced by the `FromHex` and `ToHex` traits. (#372)
- Changed `Patch` and `Changes` from typedefs into opaque structures. (#371)
- Help text is displayed if required argument is not specified. (#390)

### Removed
- Removed `round` method from the `ServiceContext`. (#366)
- Removed redundant `FromRaw` trait. (#372)
- Removed redundant `current_height` method in `Schema`. (#379)

### Fixed
- Fixed `crate_authors!` macro usage, this macro can't return static string in new clap version. (#370)
- Fixed mistake in description of the height getter in the `ServiceContext`. (#366)

## 0.3 - 2017-11-02

### Added
- New events implementation based on the `tokio` with the separated queues for network events and timeouts and different threads for the network and node code (#300)

- Implement `FromStr` and `ToString` traits for public sodium types (#318)
- Add a new macro `metric!` for collecting statistical information (#329)
- Make type `DBKey` public because it is used in `MapProof` (#306)

### Changed
